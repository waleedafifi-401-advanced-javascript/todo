## Project: To Do

**Author:** _Waleed A. Afifi_

To Do List Manager Phase 2: Connecting the To Do Application to an external API and Database
In this phase, we’ll be connecting our application to an API so that our list will be saved permanently. This will require a working and deployed API server with a proper “To Do” data model and appropriate REST routes


### Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/waleedafifi-401-advanced-javascript/todo.git
cd todo
npm i
```

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)
```
npm start
```

#### How to use your library (where applicable)
Add new items to the to-do list to see them pop up on the left. Click on items to watch the count go up and down and to see the style of the list items change.

#### Tests

There is one test that shows that typing in a new list item and clicking submit will render it to the screen.
```
npm test
```
